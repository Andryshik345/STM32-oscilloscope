# STM32-oscilloscope
Just a simple oscilloscope that can be made with a cheap STM32F103 board and a single resistor (or even without it, but at your own risk)!
- Based on [Pingumacpenguin's STM32-O-Scope work](https://github.com/pingumacpenguin/STM32-O-Scope), go see for it!
- A simple plotter was written by me to make the process a little easier.
- It works! (somehow)

## Features
- Updates around every three seconds.
- Plot window is barely accesible.
- Has tons of bugs and things, but it works.
- MCU code was also modified (with [@RipleyTom](https://github.com/RipleyTom) help, thanks to him!).
- Didn't help with my main goal.

Go to [Pingumacpenguin's STM32-O-Scope repository](https://github.com/pingumacpenguin/STM32-O-Scope) to find the building guides and original code.
